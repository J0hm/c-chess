## Big todos
-  Zobrist hashing of boards

## Next steps
- ~~Finish parse FEN tests~~
- ~~Hashing~~
- Integrate setting hash w/ parsefen
- ~~Test hashing vs. polyglot~~
    - Note: this also tests parse FEN, since the BB needs to be parsed properly for tests to pass
- ~~Implement and test board equality~~
- ~~magic bitboards~~
    - ~~Test~~
- Ensure static, restrict, inline, & const qualifiers are used correctly
- ~~movegen -> do BEFORE finishing make/unmake~~
    - test
- ~~Decide on board history and make/unmake move~~
    - Make board_equal_exact ignore board history
- ~~makeMove function~~
- ~~move legality checking~~
- ~~check detection~~
- ~~Board state history~~
- ~~unmakeMove~~
- ~~perft testing - isolate spots where movegen is off~~
